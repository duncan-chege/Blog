# Techie Talk

This is a flask blog where a writer posts blogs and a user can view and comment on them

## Author Information
Written by *Duncan Chege*. My first attempt at interating psql into my flask app including an API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install flask in your repository folder 
3. Run the IP address on the browser
4. First, create a new writer authentication account using this link to maneuver through the application:                                                https://thelastblog.herokuapp.com/authenticate/register
This will prevent anyone from becoming a writer as only a specified number of writers can post blogs on the application

## Behaviour Driven Development

| Behavior our program should handle | Input description |  Output description
| --- | --- | --- |

| `Registration into the app` | Writer credentials |  Redirection to login form
| `View most recent blogs` | Blogs in separate form |  Arranged list of blogs
| `View random quotes` | None |  A random quote is displayed
| `Comments from a user` | Comment|  Comment along with user's name
